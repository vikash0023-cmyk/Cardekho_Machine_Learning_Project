🚗 CarDekho Predictive Analysis | Machine Learning Project

📌 Project Overview
The CarDekho Predictive Analysis project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict used car prices based on multiple features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and engine specifications.

This project simulates a real-world business problem faced by automobile marketplaces and demonstrates end-to-end data science skills — from data preprocessing to model deployment readiness.

🎯 Objective:
To help car buyers and sellers make data-driven pricing decisions by accurately predicting car prices using historical data.

🧠 Business Problem
Used car pricing is influenced by multiple dynamic factors. Manual pricing often leads to:

Overpriced listings

Undervalued assets

Reduced customer trust

This project addresses these challenges by:

Identifying key price-driving factors

Building a robust predictive ML model

Providing insights that support business strategy and revenue optimization
